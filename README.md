# Project Demon Hunter Hunter
Simple GUI tool to change and insert your own custom music in Killing Floor 2.  
![Killing Floor Music Tool](https://github.com/overlandandseas/projectdemonhunterhunter/raw/master/assets/github/kf2musictool.png)
### Requirements
+ Killing Floor 2
+ [Wwise Authorization Tools v2015.1.4](https://www.audiokinetic.com/download/?id=2015.1.4_5497) (other versions have been known to work but was developed with *v2015.1.4* in mind)

### Installation
Download from here. Extract to any location and run **KFMusicTool.exe**.

### How to use
**Note**  
It will search for Wwise and Killing Floor 2 installations in the default locations. If you have multiple installations of Wwise or Killing Floor 2 those are not supported at this time.


If it could not find Killing Floor 2 or Wwise please click the button and search for KFGame.exe and Wwise.exe.  
After it finds them it will show the list of songs. Click the button on the right and upload a wav file.  
**WAV FILES ONLY.**  
When you upload a wav file it will start converting it into a wem file. This process takes up to 20 seconds and can only process one file at a time. After that load up Killing Floor 2 and enjoy.

### Development
It was developed on windows and uses specific windows style filepaths. (Backslashes instead of forward slashes).

### Contributing
When contributing to the repo is always welcome and encouraged. There is currently no eslint or styleguide to follow. Try to see the style of js I have in place.
+ No semi colons.
+ Use `=>` instead of `function` wherever possible.
+ Do not use parenthensis if a function only has one parameter.
+ Try to follow an OO model. If you must make a new file as if It can be abstracted in a class at all.
