Project demon hunter hunter (wip)

This will take a .wav file, turn it into a .wem file and place it in the correct location where your kf2 library is installed.

This is titled as it is to avoid SEO detection of an unfinished product. It is also a private repo but I only get one of these so If i need to make something else private I have a fallback.


TODO:
    make work
    integrate ci workflow with travis ci.
